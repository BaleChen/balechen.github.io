## AI Interest Group

At NYU Shanghai, I co-founded the AI Interest Group with Margaret Mao, Yuxuan Xia, and Xinqi Zou. We have successfully held many workshops and seminars in from 2023 to 2024. Yet, I am not actively managing this group anymore. If you are interested, please visit [here](https://github.com/NYUSH-AIIG) and get in touch with the current admin board memebers.

## Vocal Performance

I have been a bass singer in NYU Shanghai's *Octave Fusion* A Cappella Choir for almost 3 years. My vocal range is B1 (which is probably what got me recruited) - D4. Below is my lovely A Cappella family!
